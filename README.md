### `template/`

This is a template application to create your own IVI application, it contains the minimum needed 
to create a TomTom IndiGO application with all the default functionality from the platform.

### `keystore/`

The keys needed to sign the application with the same keys as the TomTom Indigo reference hardware 
build (see 
[Flashing the reference hardware](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-indigo/documentation/integrating-tomtom-indigo/flashing-the-reference-hardware)
) for more details on the reference hardware).

### `permissions/`

Platform permissions needed on hardware for some of the functionality (related to media) to work. 
This file will work with the template app, if another example app is used, please update the 
package name at the top of the file. See 
[Installing TomTom IndiGO on Hardware](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-indigo/documentation/integrating-tomtom-indigo/installing-tomtom-indigo-on-hardware) 
for more information about the permissions.

## Building and running

In order to build the project using dependencies from the IVI Nexus repository, credentials need to
be provided to access this repository. This can be done in different ways:

### `Store credentials in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties`

```bash
nexusUsername=<username>
nexusPassword=<password>
```

__Note:__ On some operating systems, a hash character `#` in the username or password must be
escaped as `\#` to be properly recognized.

And then build with:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### `Specify credentials through the commandline`

```bash
./gradlew -PnexusUsername=<username> -PnexusPassword=<password> build
```
