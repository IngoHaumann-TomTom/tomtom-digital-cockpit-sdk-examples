## Building and running

In order to build the project using dependencies from the IVI Nexus repository, credentials need to
be provided to access this repository. This can be done in different ways:

### `Store credentials in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties`

```bash
nexusUsername=<username>
nexusPassword=<password>
```

__Note:__ On some operating systems, a hash character `#` in the username or password must be
escaped as `\#` to be properly recognized.

And then build with:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### `Specify credentials through the commandline`

```bash
./gradlew -PnexusUsername=<username> -PnexusPassword=<password> build
```
