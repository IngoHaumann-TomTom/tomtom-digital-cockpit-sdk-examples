title: Accessing TomTom IndiGO SDK Example Sources
---

The example sources that come with the TomTom IndiGO platform contain the source code that goes
with the tutorials, to get you started with developing for TomTom IndiGO. The applications also
allow you to verify your build environment by making sure Gradle can build a TomTom IndiGO example
APK and install it on an emulator.

__Note:__ When you decide to store (parts of) the SDK in a repository, please make sure that it is
not publicly accessible.

The latest example sources for the TomTom IndiGO platform can be downloaded from GitHub:
https://github.com/tomtom-international/tomtom-digital-cockpit-sdk-examples

Run the following command to clone the sources:

```cmd
git clone :git@github.com:tomtom-international/tomtom-digital-cockpit-sdk-examples.git
```

To see the latest version of the sources, check out the `main` branch:

```cmd
git checkout main
```

The source is tagged for each release of the SDK. To see the sources of a specific version, run the
following command:

```cmd
git checkout tags/<sdk-version>
```
