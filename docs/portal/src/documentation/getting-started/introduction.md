Before you can dive into TomTom IndiGO, you need to be able to access all the resources that are
required to build a TomTom IndiGO product. Click the button below to request _early access_. If
granted, you'll be sent an Evaluation Agreement (EA).

<div class="button button--bg-brand-red button--bg-hoverable button--size-large">
    <a class="button__link"
        href="https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-indigo/request-access"
        tabindex="0">REGISTER FOR EARLY ACCESS</a>
</div>

After you have provided a signed EA, you will receive the TomTom repository credentials that allow
you to access the TomTom IndiGO SDK. Now you can build and run TomTom IndiGO.

## Minimal Requirements

The TomTom IndiGO SDK has the following minimal requirements:

- OpenJDK 11. (AdoptOpenJDK 11 for Windows.)
- Android Studio `Chipmunk | 2021.2.1` or newer.
- __Windows:__ WinRAR, to support compressed archives with long paths.
