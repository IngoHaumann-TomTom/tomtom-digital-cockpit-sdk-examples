Before you can dive into TomTom Digital Cockpit, you need to be able to access all the resources that are
required to build a TomTom Digital Cockpit product. Click the button below to request _early access_. If
granted, you'll be sent an Evaluation Agreement (EA).

<div class="button button--bg-brand-red button--bg-hoverable button--size-large">
    <a class="button__link"
        href="https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/request-access"
        tabindex="0">REGISTER FOR EARLY ACCESS</a>
</div>

After you have provided a signed EA, you will receive the TomTom repository credentials that allow
you to access the TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK. Now you can build and run TomTom Digital Cockpit.
