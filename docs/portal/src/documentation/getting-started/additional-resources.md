title: Additional Resources
---

TomTom IndiGO is written in Kotlin for the Android platform. If either of these are new or
relatively new to you, please find some resources here that will explain them further. There is also
a _Java to Kotlin_ resource, in case you _are_ familiar with Java but not with Kotlin.

Kotlin:

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/): Learn about Kotlin on their references and
  tutorials pages.
- [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/koans.html): Once you're more familiar with Kotlin, you
  can test your knowledge by doing some Kotlin Koans.
- [From Java to Kotlin](https://fabiomsr.github.io/from-java-to-kotlin/index.html): To see how
  certain Java constructs are done in Kotlin: basics, functions, and classes.
- [Kotlin's scope functions](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2019/07/lets-also-apply-run-with-kotlin-scope-functions/):
  To learn more about the `let`, `also`, `apply`, `run`, and `with` scope functions.

Android:

- [Android Getting Started Resources](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/getting-started-resources):
  This is a good place to get familiar with Android.
- [Android Kotlin fundamentals course](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-kotlin-fundamentals/):
  This course assumes you have at least a basic understanding of Kotlin and will show you how to
  create apps for Android.

TomTom IndiGO makes heavy use of certain Android features. Please make sure you have a good
understanding of these:

- [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata):
  A lifecycle-aware observable data holder.
- [Data binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding):
  Binding UI controls in layouts directly to data sources in code.
- [View binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding):
  Accessing UI controls defined in layouts from code, without using `findViewById()`.

Next, you could follow along our
[tutorials](/tomtom-indigo/documentation/tutorials-and-examples/overview)
to get a better understanding of how TomTom IndiGO uses these technologies.
