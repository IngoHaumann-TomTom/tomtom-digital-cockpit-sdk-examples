title: Accessing the Artifact Repository
---

When you provided the
[signed Evaluation Agreement](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/getting-started/introduction),
you would have received the credentials to access the
[TomTom Digital Cockpit Nexus repository](https://repo.tomtom.com/#browse/browse:ivi:com%2Ftomtom%2Fivi%2Fplatform),
a binary repository hosted by TomTom. The build process needs these credentials to retrieve TomTom
Digital Cockpit platform dependencies from the repository.

These credentials can be passed to the build process in several ways:

- [Storing credentials globally](#storing-credentials-globally)
- [Specifying credentials on the command line](#specifying-credentials-on-the-command-line)

__Note:__ When you decide to store the binary artifacts or the Nexus credentials in a repository,
please make sure that it is not publicly accessible.

## Storing credentials globally

You can store the credentials in your `gradle.properties` file, in the directory specified by the
`GRADLE_USER_HOME` environment variable, usually `~/.gradle/`. When such a file does not exists yet,
you can create one.

<Blockquote type="warning" hasIcon>
    Make sure you add the credentials to the `gradle.properties` file in the Gradle directory in
    your **user home** (`Linux/Mac: /Users/<username>/.gradle` or Windows: `%UserProfile%\.gradle`).
    If you configure the credentials in the `gradle.properties` file in your project, you will 
    not have access to the project's dependencies on the TomTom Digital Cockpit Nexus repository 
    and will receive build errors like `Received status code 401 from server: Unauthorized`.
</Blockquote>

In your `gradle.properties` file, add the following:

```cmd
nexusUsername=<your-username>
nexusPassword=<your-password>
```

__Note:__ On some operating systems, a hash character `#` in the username or password must be
escaped as `\#` to be properly recognized.

## Specifying credentials on the command line

When you don't like storing credentials in a local properties file, you can provide them on the
command line when invoking Gradle. For example:

__Linux or Mac:__
```cmd
./gradlew -PnexusUsername=<username> -PnexusPassword=<password> build
```

__Windows:__
```cmd
.\gradlew.bat -PnexusUsername=<username> -PnexusPassword=<password> build
```
