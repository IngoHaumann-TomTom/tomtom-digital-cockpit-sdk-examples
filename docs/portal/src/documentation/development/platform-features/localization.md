The [Android resource framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources)
provides [localization support](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization).
On top of the standard Android resource framework, TomTom Digital Cockpit provides additional tooling and
additional metadata to facilitate localization and programmatic changing of localization settings.

## Localize strings

See [Localize Strings](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/tutorials-and-examples/localization/localize-strings)
for more detailed information about the additional tooling and metadata for creating additional 
language resources.

__Note:__ TomTom defines strings in British English. If the U.S. English localization for a string
is not (yet) provided by TomTom, the British English string definition is used as a fallback.

## Change localization programmatically

See [Change Localization Settings](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/tutorials-and-examples/localization/change-localization-settings)
for more information on the TomTom Digital Cockpit Localization Settings API and what localization
customisations it supports.
