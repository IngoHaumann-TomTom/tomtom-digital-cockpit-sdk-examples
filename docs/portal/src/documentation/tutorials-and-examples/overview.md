This is a list of tutorials and how-to guides on topics that you may come across while developing 
for the TomTom IndiGO platform. Each how-to guide explains step-by-step how you can extend 
TomTom IndiGO.


## Example application

The example application is provided as a sample implementation. The application allows you to 
verify your build environment by making sure Gradle can build this TomTom IndiGO example APK and 
install it on an emulator. The application also contains several examples on how to add 
functionality to your product.

Check out the functionality of the TomTom IndiGO platform in the 
[walk-through](/indigo/documentation/platform-overview/example-app) of the example application, or get 
it yourself by following our [getting started](/indigo/documentation/getting-started/introduction)
