TomTom Digital Cockpit is a framework that delivers Android-based digital cockpits. It includes an
application platform to support the development of highly integrated applications on top of Android
Automotive. It also offers a complete set of industrial strength end-user applications that can be
customized to the needs of a car maker. Take the in-car experience to new places and get started
with our comprehensive SDK that includes APIs, supporting documentation, and code examples.

Creating a TomTom Digital Cockpit product requires two distinct activities: development of the
software using the TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK, and integrating that software in the vehicle.
Development for TomTom Digital Cockpit is an independent activity, and can be achieved using
emulators and mobile devices. We provide information on both parts here on this developer portal.

## API Reference

Developing for TomTom Digital Cockpit requires a set of Application Programming Interfaces (API):
the main TomTom Digital Cockpit API and the TomTom Android Tools API. The reference documentation
for both can be found on the
[API reference documentation page](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/api-reference/api-reference).
It provides the details of all classes and functions, and insights into the relation between all
modules and packages.

## Releases

Releases and release notes can be found on the
[Releases page](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/releases/releases) page.  The latest Example Application can
be downloaded from the TomTom Digital Cockpit external binary repository, using the credentials you
received after signing the Evaluation Agreement (EA). To request access, please go to the
[Getting Started](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/getting-started/introduction)
guide, and "Register for early access".
