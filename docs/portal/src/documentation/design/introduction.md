title: Introduction
---

The TomTom Digital Cockpit design documentation provides an overall picture of the TomTom Digital Cockpit design 
framework, application suite, UI controls, and design guidance for building an IVI with TomTom 
Digital Cockpit. It fits the needs of various target audiences from carmakers to TomTom Digital Cockpit partners.
It's written for Design & Development teams that want to know what is being offered, how the 
TomTom Digital Cockpit stock applications work, how they can extend and customize those applications or 
build new applications in a consistent and unified way.

    The design documentation is an ongoing effort. The first batch of documentation will cover the 
    most relevant use cases, and it will be extended every quarter.
