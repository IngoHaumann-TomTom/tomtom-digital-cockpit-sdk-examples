title: Getting a TomTom API Key
---

The TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK uses TomTom's online Navigation services, for which an API key is 
required. 
An evaluation key with limited authorization can be
[acquired immediately](#registering-as-a-tomtom-developer).
After signing 
[TomTom's evaluation agreement](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/getting-started/introduction), 
additional authorizations will be granted and you can experience the full functionality of the 
TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK and Navigation.

__Note:__ When you decide to store the TomTom API key in a repository, please make sure that it is
_not_ publicly accessible.

__Note:__ When you do not intend to use the Navigation services, there is no need to set an API key.
However, the build process fails when no API key has been configured. You can set a Gradle property
that allows building without the API key, but then TomTom Digital Cockpit will not have any
online services working, such as Live Traffic, Long Distance Electric Vehicle Routing and map
updates. Locate
[the Gradle properties file](https://github.com/tomtom-international/tomtom-digital-cockpit-sdk-examples/blob/main/gradle.properties),
as explained in the [Configuring your API key](#configuring-your-api-key) section, and add the
following line. You can then  skip the rest of this page.

```cmd
disableAutomotiveUiApiKeyBuildTimeCheck=true
```

## Registering as a TomTom Developer

- Navigate to [developer.tomtom.com](https://developer.tomtom.com/), click `Register`, and fill out
  the registration form.
- You will receive a confirmation email; click `Activate Account` and go to your
  [TomTom Developer dashboard](https://developer.tomtom.com/user/me/apps).
- The API key you get assigned should be used in the TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK, but it must still 
  be authorized by TomTom for the Navigation features used by TomTom Digital Cockpit. See also 
  section [Evaluation agreement](#evaluation-agreement).

## Configuring your API key

Now that you have received your TomTom API key, it can be used with the TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK. 
Add it to your `gradle.properties` file. The `gradle.properties` file is located in the folder
specified by the `GRADLE_USER_HOME` environment variable, usually
  `~/.gradle/`.
    - __Windows:__ Use the `%UserProfile%\.gradle` folder to find or create the
      `gradle.properties` file.

Add a line to have the Gradle property match your TomTom API key:

```cmd
automotiveUiApiKey=<your-tomtom-api-key>
```

## Evaluation agreement

The initial API key has restrictions on the functionality and the number of requests you can do.
To enjoy full functionality,
[apply for an evaluation agreement](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/getting-started/introduction) 
with TomTom.

__Note:__ You will not get a new API key, but TomTom will grant access to the navigation services
for your API key.
