title: Getting a TomTom API Key

    __Please note that this is an optional step.__
    
    By default the TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK has limited navigation functionality.
    More advanced features like live traffic, long-distance EV routing and map updates are only 
    available after configuring a valid API key.

    You can skip this part if you are not interested in these features.

Only after signing 
[TomTom's evaluation agreement](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/getting-started/introduction) 
authorizations will be granted to your API key and you can experience the full navigation 
functionality of the TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK.

Please follow the instructions below to obtain the API key and configure it in the SDK's build 
files.

## Registering as a TomTom Developer

- Navigate to [developer.tomtom.com](https://developer.tomtom.com/), click `Register`, and fill out
  the registration form.
- You will receive a confirmation email; click `Activate Account` and go to your
  [TomTom Developer dashboard](https://developer.tomtom.com/user/me/apps).
- The API key you get assigned should be used in the TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK, but it must still 
  be authorized by TomTom for the navigation features used by TomTom Digital Cockpit. See also 
  section [Evaluation agreement](#evaluation-agreement).

## Configuring your API key

Now that you have received your fully-authorized TomTom API key, it can be used with the TomTom 
Digital Cockpit SDK. Add it to your `gradle.properties` file. The `gradle.properties` file is 
located in the folder specified by the `GRADLE_USER_HOME` environment variable, usually 
`~/.gradle/`.
- __Windows:__ Use the `%UserProfile%\.gradle` folder to find or create the
      `gradle.properties` file.

Add a line to have the Gradle property match your TomTom API key:

```cmd
automotiveUiApiKey=<your-tomtom-api-key>
```

## Enabling the build-time configuration of the API key

Locate
[the Gradle properties file](https://github.com/tomtom-international/tomtom-digital-cockpit-sdk-examples/blob/main/gradle.properties)
and set the value of `disableAutomotiveUiApiKeyBuildTimeCheck` to `false`:

```cmd
disableAutomotiveUiApiKeyBuildTimeCheck=false
```
