The TomTom Digital Cockpit platform offers a number of features that can be incorporated within 
TomTom Digital Cockpit plugins. These are summarized here.

## Safety lock

Safety lock is a feature that allows the TomTom Digital Cockpit plugins to disable or change certain
functionality depending on whether or not it's safe for the driver to do so.

## Localization

The [Android resource framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources)
provides [localization support](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization).
On top of the standard Android resource framework, TomTom Digital Cockpit provides additional 
tooling and additional metadata to facilitate localization.

## Splash screen

The [splash screen](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/development/platform-features/splash-screen)
is shown when a user starts up TomTom Digital Cockpit and the required frontends are not yet ready.
When these frontends are ready, the splash screen is dismissed and the home screen is displayed.

## Custom fragments

Every panel is able to create their own initial fragment. It's possible to adjust the look and
behavior of a panel by customizing this fragment. A system UI host can create custom fragment rules
that replace the normal fragment of a panel with a
[custom fragment](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/development/platform-features/custom-fragments).
