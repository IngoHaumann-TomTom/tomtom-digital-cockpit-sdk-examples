It is important to allow users to customize their usage of an infotainment system. TomTom Digital 
Cockpit allows the creation of a personalized user experience by linking settings and preferences to
an active user profile. It is possible to have user profile specific settings with different
configuration values depending on the current user using the platform. This can be convenient,
for instance, when a user wants to use a UI with a dark theme and another user prefers to use a
light theme.

## Overview

Tomtom Digital Cockpit provides the [`UserProfileManagementService`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API) API to allow
services and frontends to manage user profiles. A user profile can be created with
[`UserProfileManagementService.createUserProfile`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API), it will be persistently
stored, and loaded after the service restarts. The user profile information may be updated with
[`UserProfileManagementService.updateUserProfile`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API) or deleted with
[`UserProfileManagementService.deleteUserProfile`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API). One of the created user
profiles must be set as active with
[`UserProfileManagementService.activateUserProfile`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API). When a user is set as
active, all setting values with user [`SettingScope`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API) will be reloaded. The
active user profile cannot be deleted. The service can be used to retrieve the user profiles
information as well as the ID of the active user.
