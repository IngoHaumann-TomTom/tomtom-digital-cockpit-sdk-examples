title: Implement Alexa Preview Mode
---

Alexa Preview Mode allows users to get access to a set of Alexa features without requiring a login
with an Amazon account. It is a part of the
[Alexa setup](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-auto/setup.html)
process as an alternative to signing in. Note that Preview Mode is available in North American and
European markets only.

    To use Alexa Preview Mode, your device must be allowlisted by Amazon. Please contact your Amazon
    Solutions Architect (SA) or Amazon Partner Manager to place your device on the allow list.

## Alexa Preview Mode Service

To use Preview Mode you must implement the [`AlexaPreviewModeService`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API). This
service is responsible for handling communication with AVS (Alexa Voice Service) to enable or
disable Alexa Preview Mode using the `InstantDeviceRegistration` APIs.

To be able to use this feature, Amazon requires an OEM to adhere to specific security requirements.
This means that the `InstantDeviceRegistration` API calls must be done on the OEM's backend, rather
than directly by the `AlexaPreviewModeService` or by any other service running on the device.
This is due to the usage of the refresh token and the LWA (Login With Amazon) client secret id that
should never be exposed on a device.

Therefore, `AlexaPreviewModeService` must exclusively communicate with the OEM's backend and the
OEM's backend is in charge of calling the AVS `InstantDeviceRegistration` APIs.

__Note:__ Reach out to your Amazon Solutions Architect (SA) or Amazon Partner Manager to understand
more about the preview mode security requirements and obtain documentation about the AVS
`InstantDeviceRegistration` APIs.

Please refer to the [`AlexaPreviewModeService`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API) API reference documentation for
detailed information on the Alexa Preview Mode service functions.

## OEM Backend

The OEM must implement a backend service that will be a "bridge" between the Alexa Auto device and
the AVS `InstantDeviceRegistration` APIs. It will be in charge of calling various
`InstantDeviceRegistration` APIs:

 - The API for getting a consumer token and registering a device for AVS access.
 - The API for requesting the new access token using the refresh token.
 - The API for unregistering a device.

__Note:__ Please reach out to your Amazon Solutions Architect (SA) for information about these APIs.

## Usage
Once the `AlexaPreviewModeService` is implemented, you can enable Alexa Preview Mode by passing the
[`AuthenticationType.ANONYMOUS`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API) authentication type to the 
[`VpaMediatorService.logIn`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API) function.
If this parameter is not specified, the default authentication type will be used (Code-Based
Linking).

## Frontend Setup Flow
Unlike standard Code-Based Linking (CBL) authentication, `Preview Mode` requires an OEM to show the
_Alexa Terms of Use_ and _Privacy policy_  as part of the setup flow. Please contact your Amazon
Solutions Architect for more information on how to retrieve and display the _Alexa Terms of Use_ and
_Privacy policy_. See an example of
[Preview Mode (Try Alexa) screen](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-auto/setup.html#try-alexa-preview-mode).

## Example app
The TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK comes with an example app showing how to create an Alexa Preview Mode
Service. See the
[`AlexaPreviewMode`](https://github.com/tomtom-international/tomtom-digital-cockpit-sdk-examples/tree/main/examples/alexa/alexapreviewmode)
directory.
