This is a list of tutorials and how-to guides on topics that you may come across while developing
for the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform. Each how-to guide explains step-by-step how you can extend
TomTom Digital Cockpit.


## Example applications

The example applications are provided as sample implementations. The applications allow you to
verify your build environment by making sure Gradle can build this TomTom Digital Cockpit example
APK and install it on an emulator. The applications also contain several examples on how to add
functionality to your product. All the examples can be found under the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/tomtom-international/tomtom-digital-cockpit-sdk-examples/tree/main/examples)
directory.<br/>
Under the
[`template/`](https://github.com/tomtom-international/tomtom-digital-cockpit-sdk-examples/tree/main/template)
directory you can find an empty example application. This only contains the default
TomTom Digital Cockpit platform functionality, without any additional example source, which can be
used as a base for your own product.

Check out the functionality of the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform in the
[walk-through](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/platform-overview/example-apps)
of an example application, or get it yourself by following our
[getting started](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/getting-started/introduction)
