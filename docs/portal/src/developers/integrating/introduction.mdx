title: Integrating TomTom Digital Cockpit
---

When TomTom Digital Cockpit is running in a car it can potentially communicate with many subsystems
and sensors in the car. This can be to provide status of various inputs, for example which doors and
windows are open or closed, or to be able to set a setting from the UI, for example setting the
current driving mode in the car.

This requires integration with the hardware, and TomTom Digital Cockpit is built on top of the
Android Automotive OS, which provides a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that provides a consistent
interface to the many different physical transport layers in the car.

[Integration into a Vehicle](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/integrating/integration-into-a-vehicle)
section.

For TomTom Digital Cockpit to obtain the correct permissions in the Android platform, it needs to
run as a system application, and signed with the platform key. Read more about how to do this and
the hardware requirements in the
[Installing TomTom Digital Cockpit on Hardware](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/integrating/installing-tomtom-digital-cockpit-on-hardware)
section.

When developing the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform, we have used a Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e as
reference hardware. We also provide a reference image for this, based on the LineageOS, which in
turn is based on Android Automotive. Read how to obtain this image and flash the hardware in the
[Flashing the Reference Hardware](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/integrating/flashing-the-reference-hardware)
section.

TomTom Digital Cockpit also comes with support for a companion application to extend the TomTom
Digital Cockpit platform experience with functionality from the user's mobile phone. Read more about
the
[Companion Application](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/integrating/companion-application)
and how to connect to the TomTom Digital Cockpit product.
