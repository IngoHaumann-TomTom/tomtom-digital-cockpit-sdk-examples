The TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK Examples contain the implementation code needed to start developing 
your own IVI application on the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform. It contains the 
[template application](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/platform-overview/example-apps)
that show-cases all the off-the-shelf features of the Digital Cockpit platform. It also contains a set of
[example applications](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/platform-overview/example-apps#example-apps)
demonstrating how to implement your own features with the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform.

### TomTom Digital Cockpit binary artefacts

The template and example applications come with 
[Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) files to build them. The build process 
needs binary artefacts of the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform, which are pulled from the 
[TomTom binary artefact repository](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/getting-started/accessing-the-artifact-repository).
