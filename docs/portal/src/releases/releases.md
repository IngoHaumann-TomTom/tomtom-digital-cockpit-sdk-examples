Here you'll find all the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform early-access releases.

## Download the TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK

The latest TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK can be downloaded from the TomTom Digital Cockpit repository, as explained in
[Accessing TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK Example sources](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/getting-started/accessing-tomtom-digital-cockpit-sdk-example-sources).

The TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK contains the code needed to start developing for the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform.
It contains the [template application](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/platform-overview/example-apps)
that show-cases all the off-the-shelf features of the Digital Cockpit platform. It also contains a set of
[example applications](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/platform-overview/example-apps#example-apps)
demonstrating how to implement your own features with the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform.

### TomTom Digital Cockpit binary artefacts

The template and example applications come with Gradle files to build them. The build process needs
binary artefacts of the TomTom Digital Cockpit platform, which are pulled from the TomTom binary artefact
repository. This requires the same credentials that you used when downloading the SDK.
For more details, see
[Accessing the artifact repository](/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/getting-started/accessing-the-artifact-repository).

### TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK version number

The TomTom Digital Cockpit SDK version number has the format `x.y.zzzz-pppp`, where `x.y.zzzz` refers to the
TomTom Digital Cockpit platform version and `-pppp` is the version of the template and example applications.
