Here you'll find all the TomTom IndiGO platform early-access releases.

## Download the Example Application

The latest Example Application can be downloaded from the TomTom IndiGO external binary repository, 
using the credentials you received after signing the Evaluation Agreement (EA). To request access, 
please go to the [Getting Started](/tomtom-indigo/documentation/getting-started/introduction) guide, and 
"Register for early access".

The Example Application contains the code needed to start developing for the TomTom IndiGO 
platform, and contains Gradle files pointing to the binary artifacts of the release.

The credentials are also used to access the binary repository when compiling the TomTom IndiGO 
application. More details can be found in the 
[Getting Started](/tomtom-indigo/documentation/getting-started/introduction) guide.

The first part of the version number `x.y.zzzz` refers to the TomTom IndiGO platform version the 
Example Application uses. The second part `-pppp` is the version of the example application release.

Once extracted, you will find these directories:

```cmd
examples/*.apk
examples/products_indigo_examples-<version>-sources
```

The APKs can be run directly on hardware or in an Android Automotive emulator.
You can also opt to build your own APK from the sources directory.

The README in the sources folder contains information related to the structure of the application.
