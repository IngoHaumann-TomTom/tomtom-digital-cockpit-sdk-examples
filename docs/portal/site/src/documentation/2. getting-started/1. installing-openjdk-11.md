title: Installing OpenJDK 11
layout: default

IndiGO is written in [Kotlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_%28programming_language%29),
which is designed to fully interoperate with the
[Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine),
by compiling to [Java bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode).
IndiGO requires
[OpenJDK 11 (Open Java Development Kit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK),
which is a free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform. Other OpenJDK versions may
work, but have not been tested and will not be supported by TomTom.

## OpenJDK for Ubuntu

To install it, run the following command in a terminal:

```cmd
$ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

You might already have other versions of JDK installed. Verify this by running:

```cmd
$ sudo update-java-alternatives -l
java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64      1111       /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64
```

If you see the output above, then you only have OpenJDK and you are all set. If you see multiple
Java versions in the output, you need to make sure you have the correct one set as the default:

```cmd
$ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64
```

Then you can verify that the correct Java version is in use by running:

```cmd
$ java --version
openjdk 11.0.11 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2.20.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2.20.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## OpenJDK for Mac

[Adoptium Temurin JDK](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11) Java version 11 can easily be
installed on MAC using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```cmd
$ brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
$ brew install --cask adoptopenjdk11
```

Other alternatives of the OpenJDK can also be used, as long as they are Java version 11.

## OpenJDK for Windows

Download the OpenJDK installer from
[Adoptium Temurin JDK](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11):

- Select `Temurin 11 (LTS)` as Version.
- Click `Latest release` to start downloading the JDK file with `.msi` extension.
- Verify that the downloaded `.msi` file has `jdk` in its name, not `jre`.

Install the JDK by executing the downloaded `.msi` file:

- During installation, when you arrive at `Custom Setup` screen, press the cross next to
  `Set JAVA_HOME` settings and select: `Will be installed on local hard drive`.

- When finished installing, open the command prompt to make sure you are now using `OpenJDK 11`:

```cmd
    C:\Users\You>java -version

    openjdk version "11.0.13" 2021-10-19
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.13+8 (build 11.0.13+8)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-11.0.13+8 (build 11.0.13+8, mixed mode)
```
