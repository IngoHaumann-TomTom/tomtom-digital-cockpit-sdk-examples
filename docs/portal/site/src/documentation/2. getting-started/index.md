Before you can dive into IndiGO, you need to be able to access all the resources that are required
to build an IndiGO product. Click the button below to request _early access_. If granted, you'll be 
sent an Evaluation Agreement (EA).

REGISTER FOR EARLY ACCESS
</button>

### Access the IndiGO SDK

Accessing IndiGO involves these credentials:

- A Developer Portal account, which you've used to access this page.
- Repository credentials, to download the IndiGO SDK and its dependencies.
- A TomTom API key, to enable TomTom's map and navigation features.

After you've provided a signed EA, you'll receive the repository credentials that you can use to
download the IndiGO SDK. This will allow you to build and run IndiGO.

You'll also be given access to TomTom's maps and navigation features for your IndiGO product. This
capability will be added to your [API key](https://developer.tomtom.com/user/me/apps) on the
Developer Portal.

__Note:__ Only a single Developer Portal account per customer is required to obtain that extra
capability. Using that single TomTom API key in all your source code will allow you to have maps and
navigation available in your products.

## Minimal Requirements

The IndiGO SDK has the following minimal requirements:

- OpenJDK 11. (AdoptOpenJDK 11 for Windows.)
- Android Studio Arctic Fox 2020.3.1 or more recent.
- __Windows:__ WinRAR, to support compressed archives with long paths.

Get started: [Installing OpenJDK 11](/indigo/documentation/getting-started/installing-openjdk-11).
