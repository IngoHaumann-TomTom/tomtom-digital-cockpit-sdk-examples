Before you can dive into IndiGO, you need to be able to access all the resources that are required
to build an IndiGO product. Click the button below to request _early access_. If granted, you'll be
sent an Evaluation Agreement (EA).

<button
onclick="location.href='https://developer.tomtom.com/indigo/request-access'"
style="background-color:#df1b12; color:white; border:none; padding:10pt; width:30%; font-weight:bold">
REGISTER FOR EARLY ACCESS
</button>

After you have provided a signed EA, you will receive the TomTom repository credentials that allow
you to download the IndiGO SDK. Now you can build and run IndiGO.

You will also be given access to TomTom's maps and navigation features for your IndiGO product. We
will add this capability to your [API key](https://developer.tomtom.com/user/me/apps) on the
Developer Portal.

__Note:__ Only a single TomTom Developer account per customer is required to obtain that extra
capability. Using that single TomTom API key in all your source code will allow you to have maps and
navigation available in your products.

## Minimal Requirements

The IndiGO SDK has the following minimal requirements:

- OpenJDK 11. (AdoptOpenJDK 11 for Windows.)
- Android Studio Arctic Fox 2020.3.1 or more recent.
- __Windows:__ WinRAR, to support compressed archives with long paths.

__Get started:__
