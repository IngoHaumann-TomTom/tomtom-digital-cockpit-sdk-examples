In order to access IndiGO platform dependencies from the IVI Nexus repository (a binary repository
hosted by TomTom), credentials need to be provided. This can be done in different ways:

## Specifying credentials from the command line

You can add credentials with the following command:

__Linux or Mac:__
```cmd
    ./gradlew -PnexusUsername=<username> -PnexusPassword=<password> build
```

__Windows:__
```cmd
    .\gradlew.bat -PnexusUsername=<username> -PnexusPassword=<password> build
```

## Storing credentials globally

You can also store the credentials in your `gradle.properties` file, in the folder specified by
the `GRADLE_USER_HOME` environment variable, usually `~/.gradle/`.

__Windows:__ Use the `gradle.properties` file in the `%UserProfile%\.gradle` folder.

In your `gradle.properties` file, add the following:

```cmd
    nexusUsername=<your-username>
    nexusPassword=<your-password>
```
