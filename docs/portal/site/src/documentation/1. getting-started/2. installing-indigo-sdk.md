Download the latest version of the IndiGO SDK from
[Nexus](https://repo.tomtom.com/#browse/browse:ivi:com%2Ftomtom%2Findigo%2Ftomtom-indigo-sdk).

After logging in to Nexus you can find the SDK versions under `com -> tomtom -> indigo ->
tomtom-indigo-sdk`:

- Click on the `+` icon left of the latest version to open this folder.
- Click on the `tomtom-indigo-sdk-<versions>.tar.gz` file to see its details in the panel on the right.
- Click the link at `Path` in the panel on the right to start downloading the SDK.

Extract the downloaded file and you find the example app source code inside it. Then follow the
instructions below to setup an environment in which to run IndiGO.

__Windows Notes:__

- Use [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/predownload.html?&L=0) to extract the downloaded file.
- Extract to a folder with a short name, for example `C:\Indigo`.
- The IndiGO SDK contains some files with a long path name, especially in the `docs` folder, but the
  path length on Windows is restricted to 260 characters. See
  [this article in Microsoft Developer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation)
  if you wish to use longer path names.
