title: Installing OpenJDK 11
layout: default

IndiGO is written in [Kotlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)), which is 
designed to fully interoperate with the 
[Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine), by compiling to
[Java bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode). IndiGO requires 
[OpenJDK 11 (Open Java Development Kit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK),
which is a free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform. Other OpenJDK versions may 
work but are not supported.

## OpenJDK for Ubuntu

To install it, run the following command in a terminal:

```cmd
$ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

You might already have other versions of JDK installed. Verify this by running:

```cmd
$ sudo update-java-alternatives -l
java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64      1111       /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64
```

If you see the output above, then you only have OpenJDK and you are all set. If you see multiple
Java versions in the output, you need to make sure you have the correct one set as the default:

```cmd
$ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64
```

Then you can verify that the correct Java version is in use by running:

```cmd
$ java --version
openjdk 11.0.11 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2.20.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2.20.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## OpenJDK for Mac

[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) Java version 11 can easily be installed on MAC
using Homebrew:

```cmd
$ brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
$ brew install --cask adoptopenjdk11
```

Other alternatives of the OpenJDK can also be used, as long as they are Java version 11.

## OpenJDK for Windows

Download the OpenJDK installer from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html):

- Select `OpenJDK 11 (LTS)` as Version.
- Select `HotSpot` as JVM.
- Select `Windows` as Operating System.
- Select `x64` as Architecture.
- Download the JDK file with the `.msi` extension.

Install the downloaded JDK file:

- During installation, when you arrive at `Custom Setup` screen, press the cross next to
  `Set JAVA_HOME` settings and select: `Will be installed on local hard drive`.
- When finished installing, open the command prompt to make sure you are now using `OpenJDK 11`:

```cmd
    C:\Users\User>java -version

    openjdk version "11.0.11" 2021-04-20
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9, mixed mode)
```
