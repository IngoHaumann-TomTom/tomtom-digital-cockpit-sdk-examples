Provides an overview of the components we expose and their use-cases (do's and don'ts).

Includes code snippets, but also links to the individual component documentation in the API docs section.

For a more high level philosophy on the design system, we will link to Automotive Design Guidelines (FlaminGO). This is comparable to https://material.io/

Purpose: 
understanding for the UX design philosophy, it is easy to follow
