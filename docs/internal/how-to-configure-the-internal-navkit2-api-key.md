# How to configure the internal NavKit2 API key

As TomTom developer you can use our internal NavKit2 API key by setting the
`useInternalNavkit2ApiKey` property to `true` in the top level  `local.properties` file or
configure the key in the `gradle.properties` file in the Gradle user home directory. The latter
option makes the key available in any Gradle project that supports this way of configuring the key.
