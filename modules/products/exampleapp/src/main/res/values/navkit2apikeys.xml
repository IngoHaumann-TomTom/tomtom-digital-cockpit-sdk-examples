This file contain _empty_ values for the NavKit2 API keys. By default,
these values are not used. To use them:

- Configure the NavKit2 API key values in this file.
- Set the `disableNavkit2ApiKeyBuildTimeCheck` property to `true` in your `local.properties` file
  located in the root project directory or as a Gradle property.
- Make sure the Android Application class does _not_ add a
  `Navkit2ApiKeyStaticConfigurationProvider` instance as a static configuration provider.
  (This is not the case in this example by default.)

It is also possible to configure the NavKit2 API key without any code changes. You can do this by
setting the `navkit2ApiKey` property to your NavKit2 API key in the top level `local.properties`
file or as a Gradle property.

The `navkit2DefaultApiKeyConfigKey` configuration value is used as a fallback for key configuration
values that are left empty.
