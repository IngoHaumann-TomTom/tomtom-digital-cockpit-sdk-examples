# Module examples_media_userflowpolicy

## Example user flow policy customization

This is an example demonstrating how to customize the browsing experience for a specific media
source in the TomTom IndiGO stock media player UI.

The example demonstrates concepts explained in the
[Create a new media user interface](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-indigo/documentation/tutorials-and-examples/media/create-a-new-media-user-interface)
guide in the TomTom IndiGO documentation.

To be able to try the customizations in this example, other than installing it on a device, it is
also necessary to compile and install the example module [examples_media_source]: that example
contains the media source customized by this example. Trying another example or the template app
will make the differences clearer.
